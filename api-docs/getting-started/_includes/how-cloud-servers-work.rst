How Cloud Servers work
-----------------------

Whether you choose to create a server by using the Cloud Control Panel, cURL, or the nova
client, the basic steps are the same.

#. **Select a region for your Cloud Server**

   .. tip::

      To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, see
      :how-to:`special considerations<about-regions>`.

#. **Select your operating system**

   Choose from a variety of popular LinuxÂ® or Windows distributions. The operating system
   for a server is known as its image.

#. **Select a flavor for your Cloud Server**

   Cloud Server flavors are a combination of RAM, disk space, disk I/O, vCPUs, and network
   throughput. For more information on flavors, see :ref:`Flavors<flavors>`.

#. **Your server is online in just a few minutes**

   By using either the Cloud Control Panel or the API, you can upgrade or remove  your
   Cloud Servers as your needs change.
